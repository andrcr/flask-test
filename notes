Service class

- get sqlalchemy exc and wrap them in custom exc to decouple the routes from the database access class (will only expect ...ServiceException s)
- alternatively catch exceptions and return a -1 instead of the expected output

- ideally would arrange the project as module/{routes,forms,models,exceptions etc}
